== Starting/Stopping a fairy cluster with Capistrano ==

Although we can start/stop the servers by executing the command directly on each host, it is more convenient to do so with *Capistrano*. 

[http://www.capify.org/ Capistrano] is a well-known open source tool for running scripts on multiple hosts. A script interpreted by Capistrano for certain purposes is called a *recipe*.

fairy contains a recipe for starting/stopping the servers.

=== Installing Capistrano ===

You can install Capistrano simply with RubyGems (i.e. `gem` command).

{{{
sudo gem install capistrano
}}}

_Note: You don't need to install it to all related hosts, but to just one used for the operation._

=== Setup ===

Move to `$FAIRY_HOME/tools/cap_recipe` and copy `cluster.yml.sample` into `cluster.yml`.

Edit `cluster.yml` along with your cluster.
 * `run_uid`: user which runs the server on each host
 * `master`: host name on which you run the master server
 * `nodes`: list of host names on which you run the node servers

For example:
{{{
#
# fairy servers
#
run_uid: fairy
master: fairy01
nodes:
  - fairy02
  - fairy03
  - fairy04
}}}

=== Startup ===

To start the servers, hit the following commands:

{{{
cd $FAIRY_HOME/tools/cap_recipe
cap start
}}}

=== Shutdown ===

To stop the servers, hit the following commands:

{{{
cd $FAIRY_HOME/tools/cap_recipe
cap stop
}}}

_Note: Now "stop" task uses "kill -9" internally, but this is not a good way, we may change to a better way in the future._

=== Other tasks in the recipe ===

The recipe includes some tasks besides starting/stopping servers.

|| *Task* || *Description* ||
|| `ps` || Show fairy processes on the cluster ||
|| `showinfo` || Show some information of the cluster<ul><li>Versions of Ruby and fairy<li>Values of `$RUBYLIB`/`$FAIRY_HOME` environment var<li>Path of fairy command ||
|| `clear_log` || Truncate fairy log (master:`/tmp/fairy/log`) ||

You can list all available tasks with following commands:

{{{
cd $FAIRY_HOME/tools/cap_recipe
cap -T
}}}
